This is the personal page of Jacob Leander, Clinical Pharmacometrician at AstraZeneca and industrial PhD student in collaboration with Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre and Department of Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology.

I am passionate about mathematical modeling to support decision making in clinical drug development. I am particulary interested in the mixed effects approach, informative time-to-event, joint models, parameter estimation and stochastic models.
