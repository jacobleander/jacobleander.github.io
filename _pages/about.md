This is the personal page of Jacob Leander, Clinical Pharmacometrician at AstraZeneca and industrial PhD student in collaboration with <a href ="http://www.fcc.chalmers.se/">Fraunhofer-Chalmers Centre</a> and the <a href ="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/math/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at Chalmers University of Technology.

I am passionate about mathematical modeling to support decision making in clinical drug development. I am particulary interested in the mixed effects approach, informative time-to-event, joint models, parameter estimation and stochastic models.
